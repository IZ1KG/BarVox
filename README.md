# BARVOX: Assistive Communication for Semi-Verbal Individuals

**BARVOX** is an innovative assistive technology designed to empower semi-verbal individuals on the autism spectrum. The system enables effective communication by translating unique vocalizations into natural language words or phrases in real-time. With **BARVOX**, users can express themselves without the need for intermediaries, fostering greater independence and improved quality of life.

This project was awarded **Second Place** at **HackAutism 2025**, a national competition in Israel for technological solutions aimed at improving the lives of individuals with autism.

## How It Works

1. **Audio Input:** The system captures vocalizations or sounds made by the user.
2. **Recognition & Processing:** **BARVOX** utilizes **Sumit.ai's proprietary voice recognition SDK** to analyze and process the input.
3. **Personalized Dictionary:** The system matches the input with a custom-built dictionary tailored to the user’s unique vocalizations.
4. **Real-Time Response:** The system provides instant feedback, outputting the corresponding word or phrase in natural language both as text and audio.

The demo showcases how **BARVOX** identifies user-specific sounds and delivers accurate Hebrew translations, enabling seamless communication for semi-verbal individuals.

## Code & Installation

Due to the use of **Sumit.ai's unique credentials**, which were exclusively provided to me for this project, I am unable to share the full source code or provide installation instructions. These credentials grant access to **Sumit.ai's** proprietary SDK, which was essential for building **BARVOX**.
